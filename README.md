# MutantGene

MutantGene is a Python library containing 13 functions that has as its primary objective the 
characterization of genes that have suffered mutations detected via alignments of tumour sample
reads. This way, through posterior analysis, it is possible to analyse each affected gene product's
functions in the cell and attempt to understand the role each of them played in neoplasm formation.

This library extracts variant information from MAF files (stored in the Genomic Data Commons data
repository) and uses the retrieved HUGO gene symbols to locate their associated Gene Ontology (GO)
IDs organized in Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) files. From there, it converts the GO IDs into GO
terms, stored in OBO files. The end result is a dictionary containing the desired gene symbols as
keys and lists of all their retrieved GO terms as values, linking each gene to its functions and/or
locations of action in the cell.

The hope is that this library can assist doctors and researchers in a more accurate cancer diagnosis
and adequate treatment applications. This library is in its early phases and the hope is that, with
the help of a committed community, it can reach a state where it can be easily applied to scientific
research and patient diagnosis. A suggested rout for improvement is a more practical gene grouping
to isolate higher impact oncogenes, and possibly features to better characterize the actual mutations
themselves to better predict their impact on gene functions.

This library was created as an end-of-bachelor project in the course "Cellular and Molecular Biology"
(University: Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Faculty: Faculdade de CiÃªncias e Tecnologias (Portugal)).

A special thanks to Professor Ludwig Krippahl for guiding me through this project and giving me advice
on how to make this library the best it could be in the amount of time given.

## Functions

The functions are divided into 3 steps: 

### STEP 1
Step 1 deals with extracting variant information from the selected MAF file 
(the GDC stores open access MAF files [here](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22files.access%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22open%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22files.data_format%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22maf%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D))

### STEP 2
Step 2 deals with retrieving the GO IDs associated to each desired gene from
the selected GOA file (Human GOA files can be found at ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/GO/goa/HUMAN/)

### STEP 3
Step 3 deals with converting the collected GO IDs into their corresponding
GO terms using an OBO file (other OBO files can be found [here](http://geneontology.org/docs/download-ontology/))
